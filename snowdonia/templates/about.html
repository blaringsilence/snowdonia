				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					With Snowdonia's transportation force nearing 1000 vehicles, between trains, trams, taxis, and buses, it's become increasingly important to collect data about the entire transportation system in order to optimize its use, as well as improve it in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					This API provides endpoints to collect, as well as provide data relating to the public transportation system.
